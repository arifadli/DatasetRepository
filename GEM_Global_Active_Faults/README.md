# GEM Global Active Faults Database (GEM GAF-DB)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/91775241.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/91775241)


The [GEM Foundation's][gem] Global Active Faults is building a comprehensive, 
global dataset of active fault traces of seismogenic concern. The GEM GAF-DB 
comprises GIS files hosted here of fault traces and small amount of relevant 
attributes or metadata (fault geometry, kinematics, slip rate, etc.) useful for 
seismic hazard modeling and other tectonic applications. The dataset is being 
assembled primarily as a part of GEM's global Probabilistic Seismic Hazard 
Modeling efforts, although we hope that the data find wide use in research, 
education and general interest among many users.

The dataset is freely and publicly available here, under a Creative Commons 
attribution sharealike license.

The dataset currently covers most of the deforming continental regions on earth 
with the exceptions of the Malay Archipelago, Madagascar, Canada, and a few 
other regions.

The data is viewable in an interactive map [here][gaf-viewer].

### Data Types

There are three main data types used in the GAF attribute table, `tuple`, 
`integer` and `string`.

A `tuple` is a 3-[tuple] of real (floating-point or integer) numbers 
representing continuous random variables such as slip rate. The tuple has the 
format `(most-likely, min, max)`. In some instances where there is no estimated 
uncertainty in the parameter of interest, the tuple may be simply given as 
`(most-likely,,)`; this is most common for the dip of purely strike-slip 
faults. In typed databases it is actually represented by a string, so the 
parentheses and commas will be preserved.  `Rake` is in Aki-Richards 
convention. All slip rate fields except `shortening_rate` describe the slip 
rate or component on the actual fault, and are in magnitudes, i.e. are always 
positive. `shortening_rate` describes the horizontal contraction rate (heave) 
of a fault (such as a GPS measurement); this is not the dip slip rate. 
Extension across a fault is negative.

An `Integer` is used as a categorical variable in this database, typically to 
denote the relative epistemic uncertainty in a parameter.  `1` is most certain, 
`2` is moderately uncertain, and `3` is highly uncertain.  The other uses of 
`Integer` types are for table indices in many constituent datasets, and in the 
`accuracy` attribute which denotes the denominator of the map scale during 
fault mapping and digitization; for example, a fault that was mapped in GIS at 
a 1/40,000 (or 1:40,000) scale will have an accuracy of `40000`.

`String`s for fields with words.

# File Formats

The database is currently available in 4 formats, [GeoJSON], [GeoPackage], KML, 
and [ESRI ShapeFile]. Which file format is most appropriate depends on the 
software package that is being used. QGIS users and anyone making webmaps or an 
API will find the GeoJSON format most useful. This is also the version of 
record as it is tracked best with version control. However, ESRI does not seem 
to provide acceptable GeoJSON support; ArcGIS users should be able to use the 
GeoPackage format (note that we have no access to ArcGIS and are unable to test 
these files for compatibility). ESRI's legacy ShapeFile format is also provided 
but this is not a good choice as that format truncates both column names and 
longer text fields such as `Notes`.

**If you are downloading individual files instead of cloning the repository:** 
Please note that GitHub may display a version of the data that is formatted for 
viewing within its built-in webmap, and not display the actual data. If you 
press the 'Download' button, however, you may download the real file.


Additional file formats will be provided once the Version 1 of the database is 
complete; if you have specific needs, please contact richard dot styron at 
globalquakemodel.org.
