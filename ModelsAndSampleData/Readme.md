EQ Transformer: An AI-Based Earthquake Signal Detector and Phase Picker

EQTransformer is an AI-based earthquake signal detector and phase (P&S) picker based on a deep neural network with an attention mechanism. It has a hierarchical architecture specifically designed for earthquake signals. EQTransformer has been trained on global seismic data and can perform detection and arrival time picking simultaneously and efficiently. In addition to the prediction probabilities, it can also provide estimated model uncertainties.

The EQTransformer python 3 package includes modules for downloading continuous seismic data, preprocessing, performing earthquake signal detection, and phase (P & S) picking using pre-trained models, building and testing new models, and performing a simple phase association.
