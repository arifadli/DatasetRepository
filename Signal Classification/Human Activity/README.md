Deskripsi
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performedsix activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

An updated version of this dataset can be found at [Web Link]. It includes labels of postural transitions between activities and also the full raw inertial signals instead of the ones pre-processed into windows.
